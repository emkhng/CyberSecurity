##### Technological Ecosystem:
Understanding the potential of the technology in your home is very important. A lot of people are content with not having internet in parts of their house, let alone in their yard. By adding just a couple wireless access points (ap), you can drastically change the outcome of the technological ecosystem in your home.
* **Wireless Access Points:**
For the most part, wireless ap's are **inexpensive** and can drastically improve the wifi areas around your house. On some units, you can get ranges of a 200' radius. By adding a couple outside your house and a couple outside, you can be sure you will have **wifi wherever you are**. They are also very customizable to where if the signal of one is stronger than another, it will **seamlessly** switch ap's without the consumer having to do anything from their end.
