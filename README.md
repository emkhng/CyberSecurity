#### Reason for Tutorial:
1. Create a secure technological ecosystem for friends and family 
2. Protect devices from unwanted users
3. Prevent problems before they happen
#### Target Audience:
_Technology_ is **rising** and it is important to protect what we love. By **helping all ages** understand **simple knowledge** to keep their devices safe, we can **encourage the growth** of technology over time.

##### Technological Ecosystem:
Understanding the potential of the technology in your home is very important. A lot of people are content with not having internet in parts of their house, let alone in their yard. By adding just a couple wireless access points (ap), you can drastically change the outcome of the technological ecosystem in your home.
* **Wireless Access Points:**
For the most part, wireless ap's are **inexpensive** and can drastically improve the wifi areas around your house. On some units, you can get ranges of a 200' radius. By adding a couple outside your house and a couple outside, you can be sure you will have **wifi wherever you are**. They are also very customizable to where if the signal of one is stronger than another, it will **seamlessly** switch ap's without the consumer having to do anything from their end.

##### Protection & Prevention:
**Keeping devices and personal information safe** should be on the top of anyone's list. When a hacker can get into your network, it allows any devices connected to your network at **risk of being compromised**. A _managed switch_ is a good choice to keep from all of your devices getting hit at once. 
* **Managed Switch:**
A switch **combines devices of similarity** together with a variety of tags. The tags work as a **wall** that in case of a compromised network, all your devices will not be affected. A Power-over-ethernet (POE) switch will allow you to **directly hardwire devices** with an ethernet connection. Some include cameras, access points, TVs, and printers. POE switches are nice because you do not have to worry about having a power connection close to the devices because they will be powered directly from the switch.

##### Conclusion:
There are **simple measures** a homeowner can take that will allow them to make the most out of their technology. By **extending** your wifi range and adding managed switches, you are not only making a noticeable difference in their use of their technology but also taking the steps needed to keep their devices **safe**.
